RageUI LSCustoms

Redone LSCustoms with a few things to match the needs on my server, I currently don't have the time to maintain this resource, that's why I'm releasing this to the public
It's currently only tranlated in portuguese (sorry :D), feel free to improve upon my work. <b>I only ask that if you fork this resource write the changes in the README.md file</b>

<b>IMPORTANT</b><br>
<b>You will need to change the default ESX GetVehicleProperties and SetVehicleProperties client/functions.lua file to get this to work, I left a file with my changes to the client/functions.lua from es_extended</b>

<b>Features</b>
<li>New menu</li>
<li>No more free upgrades like in esx_lscustoms</li>
<li>Shopping cart showing all items and the total</li>
<li>Shop can select it's profit ranging from 0% to 100% (remove items from cart by pressing "space bar" while selecting an item</li>
<li>If you leave the blip without paying the car resets</li>
<li>RGB Colors</li>
